Continuation of the cross-course project. A project that spans several courses. 

## Description

The cross-course project is a project that have been worked on through 5 different courses. It started with designing the website, then onto creating it in html and css. After creating it in only HTML and CSS, we then added JavaScript to the web page, with added cart functionality and added API fetching for fetching information and images. In the Interaction Design course we did some user testing on the web page, and then lastly we implemented the WordPress API for fetching data and images.

The project itself is a web page about a fictional online game store called GameHub. On the store you can view games, add them to cart, and go through a checkout system.
